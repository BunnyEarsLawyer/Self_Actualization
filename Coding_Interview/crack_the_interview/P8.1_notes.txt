Triple step

152: Approach this from the top down. What is the last hop the child made?
178: If we knew the number of paths to each of the steps before step 100, could
     we compute the number of steps to 100?
217: We can compute the number of steps to 100 by the number of steps to 99, 98, and 97.
     This corresponds to the child hopping 1,2,3 steps at the end.
     Do we add those or multiply them?
     If it's f(100) = f(99) + f(98) + f(97) 
     or      f(100) = f(99) * f(98) * f(97) 
237: Multiply the values when it is 'we do this, then this'
     Add them when it's 'we do this OR this'
262: What is the runtime of this method? think carefully. Can you optimize it?
359: Try memoization as a way to optimize an inefficient recursive program.
