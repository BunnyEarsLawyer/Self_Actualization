If statements let you control whether a program enters a section of code or not based 
on a given condition being true or false.

This is the first time you have a program that has a different behaviors based on the input.

Vocab:
Body       = What actually gets executed.
Expression = is a statement, or a series of statements linked together, that evaluate to a value: true or false.

// Oh my gosh! Everything is an expression.

I'm hungry = T or F

To the compiler, an expression is true if it evaluates to a NONZERO number.
+ = true
0 = false
-1 = error ?

if(1) => Always true
if(0) => Never executed 

Relational Operators = comparisons
if (x==2)
//Easier to read than:
if ( (x==2) == true)

Order of operations: 

1. NOT
2. comparisons
3. AND
4. OR
