The Class

Bjarme Strousrup created C++, he wanted to reinforce the idea of creating structures that were defined by the functions they provided. 

Instead of by the data used for the implementation.

// Note: Much like how mathematicians define the number 1. It is by looking at how the number works with other number (E.g.1*any number = that number)

A class is like a structure but it adds the ability what methods and adata are internal to the class.

Vocab
Class = like 'category'

A class is no longer structured data, instead classes are ***defined by the methods that they provide as their interface***

- They keep you from accidentally using implementation details.

- The default is, nothing is available to anyone except the methods that are part of the class!
