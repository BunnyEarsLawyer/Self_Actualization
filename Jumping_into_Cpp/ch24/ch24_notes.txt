The lifecycle of a class

When you create a class, you want to make it as easy to use as possible.

3 basic operations a class needs to to:

1. Initializing itself
2. Cleaning up memory or other resources
3. Copying itself

- Important to create a good data type
- E.g. string
  - Initialize itself, even as an empty string, available to use immidietly
  - Once you are done, string needs to clean after itself (clean the allocated memory automatically)
  - Allow copying from one variable to another 

Making it hard to use improperly.

Object Construction:

- The C++ code that runs when an object is declared is the 'constructor'
- A constructor should be set up so that the object can be used without futher initialization.
- A constructor can take arguments
  
  E.g. vector<int> v(10); 

  - Calls the vector constructor witht he value 10 so it can hold 10 things.   

how to create a constructor:
- same name as the class
- takes no arguments
- returns no return value

See constructor.cpp
